This project aim is to create a saas that let small and medium shop owners to start collect data about their customers with minimum effort

How it works and which data is this software collecting?

The software is using a simple cam(could be a simple webcam, a security cam already present in the business or a new one) to identify the customer face and take a picture of that.
Once the picture is taken it will be detected the age, gender and approx time spent of the customer (in test there is also emotion recognition)
This data will be collected once per customer every day and will be fed in a sql database.
This will enable the shop owner to know his customer base and take meaningful decisions for his business with more data in hand.
